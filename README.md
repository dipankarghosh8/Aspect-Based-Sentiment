# Aspect-Based-Sentiment
Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a text analysis technique that categorizes data by aspect and identifies the sentiment attributed to each one. It can be used to analyze customer feedback by associating specific sentiments with different aspects of a product or serviceaspect-based-sentiment-analysis is a Python package that provides a modern NLP package which supports explanations of model predictions and can be freely extended to your needs 1.

The task is to classify the sentiment of potentially long texts for several aspects. The key idea is to build a modern NLP package which supports explanations of model predictions. The approximated decision explanations help you to infer how reliable predictions are.

## Datasets

The datasets are available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZSo7FlaNpEcEyigUX7nmnsYqMsS7FABH?usp=sharing. The downloaded datasets (i.e., the dataset folder) need to be moved into the root path of this project.

Our experimental dataset is `dataset/covid19_tweets.csv`, which is a CSV file contains data about covid19 related tweets. In the CSV file,

- the `user_name` identifies the unique id of the post.
- the `user_location` identifies the veracity of the post, whose value ranges in [ `fake`,  `real`, `unverified`]. 
- the `user_description` is the content of the post.
- 
- the `comments` are the users' comments list towards the post.
- the `content_emotions_labels` and `cotent_emotions_probs` are the *Emotion Category* features of the content. And the `comments100_emotions_labels_mean_pooling`, `comments100_emotions_labels_max_pooling`, `comments100_emotions_probs_mean_pooling`, and `comments100_emotions_probs_max_pooling` are the *Emotion Category* features of the earliest 100 comments. The way how to use these features will be described in [here](https://github.com/RMSnow/WWW2021#step12-get-the-emotion-features).
